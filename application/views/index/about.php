                        <h3>What is Theatre Finder?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Theatre Finder</strong> is a comprehensive, web based, world-wide guide to all theatres that are now over 100 years old.  It provides a consistent body of reliable data on existing theatre buildings from the Menoan theatral areas of 2500 B.C.E. to the last playhouse built in 1915. Developed by Prof. Franklin J. Hildy, at the University of Maryland, with the support of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), it is collaboratively written, peer reviewed, and intended for use by those who want to visit such theatres, those who are doing serious research on them, and those who seek to preserve and maintain them.</p>
                        <p>In order to collect reliable information on theatres around the world, theatre-finder.org requires the participation of its users in the following ways:
